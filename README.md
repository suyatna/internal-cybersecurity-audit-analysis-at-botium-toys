# Botium Toys: Internal Security Audit

# Introduction <a name="introduction">
This case study is part of my cybersecurity portfolio and focuses on an internal security audit conducted for Botium Toys, a fictitious toy retail company. The project was completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, specifically within the Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks course.

The audit aims to evaluate the current state of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program and align existing business practices with industry standards and best practices. The assessment focuses on identifying key risks, security control gaps, and potential compliance issues.

The audit results are used to develop mitigation recommendations for high-risk vulnerabilities and to outline an overall strategy for improving the organization’s security posture. Findings and remediation efforts are documented to ensure clear communication with relevant stakeholders.

# Scenario <a name="scenario">
Botium Toys is entering a growth phase that requires increased reliance on digital systems to support business operations and transactions. Sales are conducted through physical stores and online platforms, while customer and payment data are managed through an expanding internal infrastructure.

As operations scale, security complexity increases. Systems that were once sufficient for a smaller business begin to show limitations in access control, asset management, and protection of sensitive data. Security risks become more apparent as the number of users, devices, and processed data continues to grow.

Management requires a clear understanding of the organization’s internal security condition before making further technology investments and expansion decisions. An internal security audit is conducted to identify critical risks, evaluate existing controls, and define practical improvement steps with the greatest impact on the organization.
